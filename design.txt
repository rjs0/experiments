For hashing:

hash each 28x28 image tensor, store in dictionary where key = hash, and value = (old label, new label)
hash entire dataset, store in dictionary where key = hash, value = index in original dataset

this allows us to check margin array and display example
for example, we can iterate through swap_table and then use this to go through full dictionary and obtain the index of the example 
whose label was swapped. then, we can simply access the original dataset using the obtained index, and do whatever want, such as plot it.
